## Architecture

```
Claude / AI Assistant ←→ MCP Server (this repo) ←→ Unity Editor Plugin (HTTP bridge)
                                ↕
                          Unity Hub CLI
```

This server communicates with:
- **Unity Hub** via its CLI (supports both modern `--headless` and legacy `-- --headless` syntax)
- **Unity Editor** via the companion [unity-mcp-plugin](https://github.com/AnkleBreaker-Studio/unity-mcp-plugin) which runs an HTTP API inside the editor

### Two-Tier Tool System

To avoid overwhelming MCP clients with 200+ tools, the server uses a two-tier architecture:
- **Core tools** (~70) are always exposed directly
- **Advanced tools** (~130+) are accessed via a single `unity_advanced_tool` proxy with lazy loading

This keeps the tool count manageable for clients like Claude Desktop and Cowork while still providing access to every Unity feature. Use `unity_list_advanced_tools` to discover all advanced tools by category.

### Multi-Instance Support

The server automatically discovers all running Unity Editor instances on startup. If only one instance is found, it auto-connects. If multiple instances are running (e.g., main editor + ParrelSync clones), it prompts you to select which one to work with.

## Quick Start

### 1. Install the Unity Plugin

In Unity: **Window > Package Manager > + > Add package from git URL:**
```
https://github.com/AnkleBreaker-Studio/unity-mcp-plugin.git
```

### 2. Install this MCP Server

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AnkleBreaker-Studio/unity-mcp-server.git
cd unity-mcp-server
npm install
```

### 3. Add to Claude Desktop

Open Claude Desktop > Settings > Developer > Edit Config, and add:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "unity": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["C:/path/to/unity-mcp-server/src/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "UNITY_HUB_PATH": "C:\\Program Files\\Unity Hub\\Unity Hub.exe",
        "UNITY_BRIDGE_PORT": "7890"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Desktop. Done!

### 4. Try It

- *"List my installed Unity editors"*
- *"Show me the scene hierarchy"*
- *"Create a red cube at position (0, 2, 0) and add a Rigidbody"*
- *"Profile my scene and show the top memory consumers"*
- *"List all Shader Graphs in my project"*
- *"Build my project for Windows"*
- *"List and start my MPPM multiplayer scenarios"*
- *"Capture a screenshot of my scene view"*
- *"Show me the active agent sessions"*

## Configuration

| Environment Variable | Default | Description |
|---------------------|---------|-------------|
| `UNITY_HUB_PATH` | `C:\Program Files\Unity Hub\Unity Hub.exe` | Unity Hub executable path |
| `UNITY_BRIDGE_HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | Editor bridge host |
| `UNITY_BRIDGE_PORT` | `7890` | Editor bridge port (auto-discovered when using multi-instance) |
| `UNITY_BRIDGE_TIMEOUT` | `30000` | Request timeout in ms |
| `UNITY_MCP_DEBUG` | `false` | Enable debug logging for troubleshooting |

The Unity plugin also has its own settings accessible via the Dashboard (`Window > MCP Dashboard`) for port, auto-start, and per-category feature toggles.

## Optional Package Support

Some tools activate automatically when their packages are detected in the Unity project:

| Package / Asset | Features Unlocked |
|----------------|-------------------|
| `com.unity.memoryprofiler` | Memory snapshot capture via MemoryProfiler API |
| `com.unity.shadergraph` | Shader Graph creation, inspection, opening |
| `com.unity.visualeffectgraph` | VFX Graph listing and opening |
| `com.unity.inputsystem` | Input Action map and binding inspection |
| `com.unity.multiplayer.playmode` | MPPM scenario listing, activation, start/stop, player info |
| Amplify Shader Editor (Asset Store) | Amplify shader listing, inspection, opening |

Features for uninstalled packages return helpful messages explaining what to install.

## Requirements

- Node.js 18+
- Unity Hub (for Hub tools)
- Unity Editor with [unity-mcp-plugin](https://github.com/AnkleBreaker-Studio/unity-mcp-plugin) installed (for Editor tools)

## Troubleshooting

**"Connection failed" errors** — Make sure Unity Editor is open and the plugin is installed. Check the Unity Console for `[MCP Bridge] Server started on port 7890`.

**"Unity Hub not found"** — Update `UNITY_HUB_PATH` in your config to match your installation.

**"Category disabled" errors** — A feature category may be toggled off. Open `Window > MCP Dashboard` in Unity to check category settings.

**Port conflicts** — Change `UNITY_BRIDGE_PORT` in your Claude config and update the port in Unity's MCP Dashboard settings.
